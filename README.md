A to-do list contains all the tasks that need to be done and can be ticked off accordingly. It is suitable for every person involved in a project, as it can be 
customised and provides more clarity. By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important.
And by prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave until later.
